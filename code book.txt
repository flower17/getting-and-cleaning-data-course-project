activity_label - one of six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) that each person performed

person_id - id of a person who performed activities (30 people took part in performing activities, each performed 6 activities)

Mean value calculated for body acceleration signals in 3 axis (X, Y, Z)
t_body_acc_mean_x
t_body_acc_mean_y
t_body_acc_mean_z

Standard deviation calculated for body acceleration signals in 3 axis (X, Y, Z)
t_body_acc_std_x
t_body_acc_std_y
t_body_acc_std_z

Mean value calculated for gravity acceleration signals in 3 axis (X, Y, Z)
t_gravity_acc_mean_x
t_gravity_acc_mean_y
t_gravity_acc_mean_z

Standard deviation calculated for gravity acceleration signals in 3 axis (X, Y, Z)
t_gravity_acc_std_x
t_gravity_acc_std_y
t_gravity_acc_std_z

Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain respective Jerk signals in 3 axis (X, Y, Z), then the mean for each of those calculated:
t_body_acc_jerk_mean_x
t_body_acc_jerk_mean_y
t_body_acc_jerk_mean_z

And standard deviation:
t_body_acc_jerk_std_x
t_body_acc_jerk_std_y
t_body_acc_jerk_std_z

Mean value calculated for body gyroscope 3-axial raw signal:
t_body_gyro_mean_x
t_body_gyro_mean_y
t_body_gyro_mean_z

Standard deviation value calculated for body gyroscope 3-axial raw signal:
t_body_gyro_std_x
t_body_gyro_std_y
t_body_gyro_std_z

Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ, tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ 

Then mean value caclucated:
t_body_gyro_jerk_mean_x
t_body_gyro_jerk_mean_y
t_body_gyro_jerk_mean_z

And standard deviation:
t_body_gyro_jerk_std_x
t_body_gyro_jerk_std_y
t_body_gyro_jerk_std_z

Magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.
Then mean and standard deviation values were calculated:
t_body_acc_mag_mean
t_body_acc_mag_std
t_gravity_acc_mag_mean
t_gravity_acc_mag_std
t_body_acc_jerk_mag_mean
t_body_acc_jerk_mag_std
t_body_gyro_mag_mean
t_body_gyro_mag_std
t_body_gyro_jerk_mag_mean
t_body_gyro_jerk_mag_std


Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The following variables contain mean and standard deviation values for the respective variables:
f_body_acc_mean_x

- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.

Tidy dataset 'groupedHarData.txt' contains 180 rows - mean value for each variable for each activity (6) and person (30) who performed the activity.
